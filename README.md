Twins
======

Using regression and machine learning techniques to answer biological questions in a dataset of twins.

Currently looked at glycomics and metabolomics in isolation and working towards analysing them together.

## Future work

* Look at LD blocks of SNP genotypes and correlate these with F-cell percentage.

* All at all SNPs and correlate these with F-cell percentage.
